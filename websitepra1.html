                Betrayal knows my name.
                I know only a one way game.
                Made of different paths.
                All going down the wrong road.
                Passageways to what is the unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                Love and hate are both strong words,
                Two of which are never applied.
                To the cruel reality of the world.
                Fairy Tales, called Tales for a reason.
                No one lives without a conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                Moon, Sun, Rain, Clouds, go away.
                Stay away, never come back until I say.
                Welcome to a world of pain.
                Where only god knows the truth.
                Hence why Betrayal Knows My Name.

                I layed on my
              bed, with a broken heart,
              I kept
              thinking, and my heart did the same by beating,
              on a fatal and
              unforgiven night, I stood with my heart beating,
              </p>
              <p>
              the only boy I like
              layed in a
              street, only moments before his body was thrown in a creak,
              alone I would find myself across
              the road, I saw everything, as my
              only friend passed, his soul
              </p>
              <p>
              moves on, then
              I stand alone, as a
              man drew near, wrecked,
              my soul wanted to fly away with him, as the man held up his bloody plank
              you only live once and my hope broke,
              </p>
              <p>
              mine was soon to be over, too soon if I may add, as
              he got closer he moved faster, all
              in the night of Christmas Eve, the
              boy was happy, to end up in the heavens
              above, we were
              not meant to end in a
              scary night, I’ve prayed to die happy in my sleep, and in the bell
              </p>
              <p>
              of time I
              slowly closed my eyes, dropped
              to the ground and sat down,
              my time wasn’t up and
               I knew that well, if I was closer down
               </p>
               <p>
              to the ground i’d be closer to the boy, who hit
              the bad guy to save me again, a
              bad guy indeed, why are they in the world,
              I was an idiot to take sides with the man, an idiot to believe I could be with
              the boy too, I never would have chosen him if I had known, but I knew none.
